# EmpathiCH

EmpathiCH aims to bring together different expertise to investigate how digital tools can be used to elicit empathy between multiple stakeholders at scale.
  
The motivation behind this works lies in the necessity of new digital-supported methodologies to design at-scale solutions to societal problems that are balanced, inclusive, and aware of their effect on society.
  
This full-day workshop includes participants' presentations, an inspiring keynote talk, and a panel of experts.
  
Stimulated by this discussion, the expertise, and experiences of the participants will be combined during a participatory session to shape the future of the "Empathy Design at Scale" research agenda.
